# Python-Hypothesis-Testing-UI
A user interface, developed in python, made for hypothesis testing. By using this, you can have in one app the ability to perform Z-Tests, T-Tests and AB-Tests.

# How to use the program
Download the archive 'Hypothesis Testing Program.zip', extract the folder inside the zip somewhere and execute the .exe file. You must have python installed in your computer.

# Code chunks
If you just want to see the code, I have uploaded the code from the 4 scripts that make up the program to github.
